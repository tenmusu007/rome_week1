          <p>Rome, Italian Roma, historic city and capital of Roma provincia
            (province), of Lazio regione (region), and of the country of Italy.
            Rome is located in the central portion of the Italian peninsula, on
            the Tiber River about 15 miles (24 km) inland from the Tyrrhenian
            Sea. Once the capital of an ancient republic and empire whose armies
            and polity defined the Western world in antiquity and left seemingly
            indelible imprints thereafter, the spiritual and physical seat of
            the Roman Catholic Church, and the site of major pinnacles of
            artistic and intellectual achievement, Rome is the Eternal City,
            remaining today a political capital, a religious centre, and a
            memorial to the creative imagination of the past. Area city, 496
            square miles (1,285 square km); province, 2,066 square miles (5,352

          <h2>Rome history</h2>
          <p>
            Beginning in the eighth century B.C., Ancient Rome grew from a small
            town on central Italy’s Tiber River into an empire that at its peak
            encompassed most of continental Europe, Britain, much of western
            Asia, northern Africa and the Mediterranean islands. Among the many
            legacies of Roman dominance are the widespread use of the Romance
            languages (Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Romanian)
            derived from Latin, the modern Western alphabet and calendar and the
            emergence of Christianity as a major world religion. After 450 years
            as a republic, Rome became an empire in the wake of Julius Caesar’s
            rise and fall in the first century B.C. The long and triumphant
            reign of its first emperor, Augustus, began a golden age of peace
            and prosperity; by contrast, the Roman Empire’s decline and fall by
            the fifth century A.D. was one of the most dramatic implosions in
            the history of human civilization.

              Italy, country of south-central Europe, occupying a peninsula that
              juts deep into the Mediterranean Sea. Italy comprises some of the
              most varied and scenic landscapes on Earth and is often described as
              a country shaped like a boot. At its broad top stand the Alps, which
              are among the world’s most rugged mountains. Italy’s highest points
              are along Monte Rosa, which peaks in Switzerland, and along Mont
              Blanc, which peaks in France. The western Alps overlook a landscape
              of Alpine lakes and glacier-carved valleys that stretch down to the
              Po River and the Piedmont. Tuscany, to the south of the cisalpine
              region, is perhaps the country’s best-known region. From the central
              Alps, running down the length of the country, radiates the tall
              Apennine Range, which widens near Rome to cover nearly the entire
              width of the Italian peninsula.
